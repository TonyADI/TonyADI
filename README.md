ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TonyADI. Iâ€™m a Full Stack Developer with an inclination towards front end development. I have a passion for visuals and a drive for server side coding. I studied at the University of Toronto and Sheridan College from 2015 to 2020, receiving a Bsc degree in Computer Science and a diploma in Digital Communications upon completion. I have worked with various languages such as Python, Java, C, C++ and so on. I have also worked with CMS's such as Wordpress and Shopify. I am passionate about different forms of media namely movies, books, and video games and intend to direct or write one someday. I also follow cryptocurrencies and stocks.
